# Raksha Pipes Data Analysis

This project involves analyzing data related to Raksha Pipes, a company specializing in the production and distribution of pipes and plumbing products. The dataset includes information about customers, products, sales, employees, exports, manufacturing units, and warehouses. The goal is to gain insights into sales trends, product performance, and customer profiles to support business decision-making.

## Overview

The project utilizes Python for data generation and SQL for database management. The generated data is stored in a MySQL database, and analysis is conducted using SQL queries. Power BI is used to create an interactive dashboard that visualizes key business metrics and insights.

## Project Components

1. **Data Generation**: Python scripts are used to generate synthetic data for customers, products, sales, employees, exports, manufacturing units, and warehouses. Faker library is employed to create realistic-looking data.

2. **Database Creation**: SQL scripts are used to create a MySQL database named "raksha_pipesdata". Tables are created for storing customer information, product details, sales transactions, employee data, export records, manufacturing units, and warehouses.

3. **Data Insertion**: Python scripts insert the generated data into the MySQL database tables.

4. **Data Analysis**: SQL queries are executed to analyze the data stored in the database. Various insights such as sales trends, product performance, and employee information are extracted using SQL.

5. **Power BI Dashboard**: An interactive dashboard is created using Power BI to visualize the analyzed data. The dashboard includes visualizations such as bar charts, line charts, pie charts, donut charts, stacked column charts, scatter plots, maps, and gauges to represent sales trends, product categories, customer profiles, and more.

## Repository Structure

- **Python Scripts**: Contains Python scripts for data generation and insertion.
- **SQL Scripts**: Contains SQL scripts for database creation and data analysis.
- **Power BI Dashboard**: Contains the Power BI file (.pbix) for the interactive dashboard.
- **Documentation**: Includes a README file providing an overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.
- **Presentation**: Contains a presentation file summarizing the project, methodology, findings, and evaluation criteria.

## Usage

1. **Data Generation**: Execute the Python scripts to generate synthetic data.
2. **Database Setup**: Run the SQL scripts to create the MySQL database and tables.
3. **Data Insertion**: Run the Python scripts to insert the generated data into the database.
4. **Data Analysis**: Execute SQL queries to analyze the data and extract insights.
5. **Power BI Dashboard**: Open the Power BI file to explore the interactive dashboard and visualize the data.

## Evaluation Criteria

The project will be evaluated based on clarity, accuracy, insightfulness, and presentation quality. The README file, documentation, and presentation should effectively convey the project's objectives, methodology, findings, and usage guidelines.
